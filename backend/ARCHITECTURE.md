**Summary of the API Server Architecture**

---

**Overview**

The API server is a central component of the temperature sensor monitoring system. Its primary responsibilities include:

- **User Management**: Handling user registration, authentication, and authorization.
- **Device Management**: Allowing users to manage their devices, including viewing and updating device information.
- **Data Retrieval**: Providing endpoints to retrieve sensor readings, with support for filtering and data aggregation.
- **Security**: Ensuring that all data access is secure and that users can only access their own data.

Since the shared module has been removed, all models and schemas are now defined directly within the API server. This means the API server contains its own database models, Pydantic schemas, and business logic pertinent to its operation.

---

**Key Architectural Components**

1. **FastAPI Framework**

   - The API server is built using **FastAPI**, a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+.
   - FastAPI leverages Python type hints, enabling automatic request validation, serialization, and documentation generation.
   - The framework's asynchronous capabilities allow for efficient handling of multiple simultaneous requests.

2. **Database Models**

   - **SQLAlchemy ORM** is used for defining database models and interacting with the PostgreSQL database.
   - Models represent the database schema; key models include `User`, `Device`, and `Reading`.
   - With the updated `Reading` model, readings now have a `reading_type` field (an `Enum` with values like `TEMPERATURE` and `HUMIDITY`) and a `value` field for the reading data.
   - Relationships between models are defined using foreign keys (e.g., each `Reading` is linked to a `Device` via `device_id`).

3. **Pydantic Schemas**

   - **Pydantic** is used for data validation and serialization/deserialization.
   - Schemas mirror the models but are used for request and response bodies, ensuring that data entering and leaving the API is properly formatted and validated.
   - Separate schemas can be defined for input (e.g., `ReadingCreate`) and output (e.g., `ReadingOut`) to control exposed fields.

4. **Authentication and Security**

   - **OAuth2 with JWT Tokens**: The API uses OAuth2 authentication flow with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication.
   - **Password Hashing**: User passwords are securely stored using a hashing algorithm like bcrypt.
   - **Dependency Injection**: Security dependencies ensure that only authenticated users can access certain endpoints.

5. **Routing and Endpoints**

   - The API is organized using routers, grouping related endpoints (e.g., `/auth`, `/users`, `/devices`, `/readings`).
   - **Versioning**: The API uses versioning in the URL path (e.g., `/api/v1`) to manage changes over time without breaking existing clients.
   - Endpoints include operations for:
     - User registration and login.
     - Retrieving and managing devices.
     - Retrieving sensor readings, with support for filtering by device, reading type, and time range.

6. **Dependency Injection**

   - FastAPI's built-in dependency injection system is employed to manage dependencies like database sessions, configuration settings, and the current authenticated user.
   - This design enhances testability and maintainability, as dependencies can be easily mocked during testing.

7. **Database Integration**

   - The API server connects to the PostgreSQL database, utilizing SQLAlchemy's asynchronous ORM capabilities for efficient database interactions.
   - **Database Sessions**: Managed asynchronously, ensuring non-blocking I/O operations.
   - **Alembic** is used for database migrations, allowing for version control of the database schema.

8. **Asynchronous Programming**

   - Asynchronous endpoints and database operations improve throughput and scalability.
   - This is critical for handling multiple concurrent client requests without performance degradation.

9. **Error Handling and Validation**

   - FastAPI and Pydantic automatically handle validation errors, returning clear error messages to clients.
   - Custom exception handlers can be implemented for more granular control over error responses.

10. **Logging and Monitoring**

    - Logging is set up to record important events, errors, and debugging information.
    - Application performance and health can be monitored using tools integrated with the deployment environment.

**How Components Tie Together**

- **Clients** (such as the frontend application) make HTTP requests to the API server to perform actions like user login, fetching device data, or retrieving sensor readings.

- **Routing Layer**: FastAPI routes these requests to the appropriate endpoint handlers based on the URL path and HTTP method.

- **Dependency Injection**: Endpoint handlers receive required dependencies (e.g., database session, current user) injected automatically by FastAPI.

- **Authentication Middleware**: For protected endpoints, authentication dependencies verify JWT tokens and ensure the user is authenticated.

- **Business Logic**: Handlers perform necessary operations, such as querying the database for readings, applying filters, or creating new records.

- **Database Interaction**: All database operations are performed using the SQLAlchemy ORM, interacting with the models defined in the API server.

- **Response Generation**: Results are serialized using Pydantic schemas and returned to the client in a structured JSON format.

**Overall Vision**

The API server acts as the backbone of the system, providing secure and efficient access to user and sensor data. The architectural decisions aim to:

- **Ensure Security**: By implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, ensuring data privacy and integrity.

- **Promote Scalability**: Through asynchronous programming and efficient database operations, the server can handle increased loads as the user base grows.

- **Facilitate Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns, modular code structure, and adherence to best practices make the codebase easier to maintain and extend.

- **Enhance User Experience**: Providing a well-designed API enables the frontend application to offer a seamless and responsive user experience.

**Technical Details and Considerations**

1. **Database Schema and Migrations**

   - **Model Changes**: With the updated `Reading` model, the database schema accommodates multiple reading types.
   - **Migrations**: Use Alembic for database migrations to manage schema changes over time safely.

2. **Authentication and Security**

   - **Password Security**: Use strong hashing algorithms and consider salting passwords.
   - **JWT Tokens**: Securely generate and validate JWT tokens, setting appropriate expiration times.
   - **HTTPS**: Ensure that the API server is served over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.

3. **Dependency Injection**

   - **Database Sessions**: Use FastAPI's `Depends` to inject database sessions into endpoint handlers.
   - **Current User**: Inject the authenticated user into endpoints that require it, ensuring access control.

4. **API Design**

   - **RESTful Principles**: Follow RESTful conventions for endpoint design, using appropriate HTTP methods and status codes.
   - **Pagination and Filtering**: Implement pagination for endpoints returning lists, and provide filtering options to clients.
